# Mr.PacMan
Mr. Pacman moving back and forth across the screen.

# Summary
This is an animation of Mr. Pacman chomping and moving to one side of the screen and the reversing to the other side of the screen endlessly using four images given by the MIT xPRO full stack development course.

# Future Improvements
Instead of Mr. Pacman going right to left, I would add a feature to also move up and down, and eventually he could move in any direction on the two dimensional plane.
